# 🎯 Artifact Edit & Operation Control - Complete

## Overview
Enhanced the artifact system with explicit CREATE, EDIT, and DELETE operations. Mistral AI now intelligently chooses the right operation and is prevented from creating duplicate artifacts.

---

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. **Three Distinct Operations**

#### CREATE (New Artifact)
- ✅ Only allowed when **no artifact exists**
- ✅ Blocked if artifact already present
- ✅ User warned: "Artifact Already Exists - please edit or delete first"
- ✅ Model instructed to use this for **completely new projects**

#### EDIT (Modify Existing)
- ✅ Updates the **current artifact** in place
- ✅ Shows "UPDATED" badge in artifact header
- ✅ Preserves artifact identifier
- ✅ Panel reopens if closed
- ✅ Model instructed to use for: modifications, improvements, feature additions

#### DELETE (Remove Artifact)
- ✅ Closes side panel
- ✅ Clears current artifact
- ✅ Frees up space for new creations
- ✅ Only executed on explicit user request

---

## 📝 New Command Format

### CREATE Operation
```xml
<artifact operation="create" type="react" title="Todo List">
```jsx
function TodoApp() {
  // ... component code
}
window.App = TodoApp;
```
</artifact>
```

### EDIT Operation
```xml
<artifact operation="edit" type="react" title="Todo List with Filters">
```jsx
function TodoApp() {
  // ... updated component code with new features
}
window.App = TodoApp;
```
</artifact>
```

### DELETE Operation
```xml
<artifact operation="delete"></artifact>
```

## 🧠 AI Decision Tree

The system prompt now includes a clear decision tree:

| User Request | Current State | AI Action |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| "Create a counter" | No artifact | **CREATE** |
| "Create a form" | Counter exists | **BLOCKED** + Warning |
| "Add a reset button" | Counter exists | **EDIT** |
| "Change the color to blue" | Counter exists | **EDIT** |
| "Make it bigger" | Counter exists | **EDIT** |
| "Delete this" | Any artifact | **DELETE** |
| "Start over with a form" | Counter exists | **DELETE** then **CREATE** |

---

## 🔍 Context Awareness

Mistral receives artifact context in every message:

```
User: "Add a reset button"

[Context: An artifact titled "Simple Counter" (type: react) is currently active. 
Use <artifact operation="edit"> to modify it, or <artifact operation="delete"> 
to remove it before creating a new one.]
```

This ensures the model **knows** an artifact exists and chooses the correct operation.

---

## 🛡️ Protection Logic

### CREATE Protection
```typescript
if (latestArtifact.operation === 'create') {
  if (currentArtifact) {
    // BLOCK: Artifact already exists
    toast({
      title: 'Artifact Already Exists',
      description: 'Please edit the existing artifact or ask me to delete it first',
      status: 'warning',
    });
    // Don't create, keep existing
  } else {
    // OK: No artifact exists, create new one
    setCurrentArtifact(artifactData);
    setIsArtifactPanelOpen(true);
  }
}
```

### EDIT Protection
```typescript
if (latestArtifact.operation === 'edit') {
  if (!currentArtifact) {
    // BLOCK: No artifact to edit
    toast({
      title: 'No Artifact to Edit',
      description: 'Please create an artifact first',
      status: 'warning',
    });
  } else {
    // OK: Update existing artifact
    artifactData = { ...currentArtifact, ...updates, updatedAt: now };
    setCurrentArtifact(artifactData);
  }
}
```

### DELETE Protection
```typescript
if (latestArtifact.operation === 'delete') {
  // Always allowed
  setCurrentArtifact(null);
  setIsArtifactPanelOpen(false);
}
```

## 📊 User Experience Flows

### Flow 1: Creating First Artifact
1. **User:** "Create a counter button"
2. **Mistral:** Uses `<artifact operation="create">`
3. **Result:** ✅ Artifact created, panel opens
4. **Toast:** "Artifact Created: Counter Button"

### Flow 2: Trying to Create When One Exists
1. **User:** "Create a todo list"
2. **Mistral:** Uses `<artifact operation="create">`
3. **Result:** ⚠️ BLOCKED - existing artifact remains
4. **Toast:** "Artifact Already Exists - please edit or delete first"
5. **User sees:** Counter button still displayed

### Flow 3: Editing Existing Artifact
1. **User:** "Add a decrement button"
2. **Mistral:** Sees context, uses `<artifact operation="edit">`
3. **Result:** ✅ Artifact updated with new button
4. **Toast:** "Artifact Updated: Counter Button"
5. **Badge:** Shows "UPDATED" label

### Flow 4: Deleting and Starting Fresh
1. **User:** "Delete this and create a calculator"
2. **Mistral:** First `<artifact operation="delete">`, then `<artifact operation="create">`
3. **Result:** ✅ Counter removed, calculator created
4. **Toast:** "Artifact Deleted" → "Artifact Created: Calculator"

### Flow 5: Smart Editing
1. **User:** "Make the buttons bigger"
2. **Mistral:** Recognizes modification request, uses `<artifact operation="edit">`
3. **Result:** ✅ Existing artifact updated with larger buttons
4. **No blocking, no warnings** - smooth edit

## 🔧 System Prompt Instructions

Key excerpt from the updated system prompt:

```
**IMPORTANT ARTIFACT RULES:**
- Only ONE artifact can be active at a time
- If an artifact already exists, you MUST use <edit> to modify it
- Only use <create> when starting a completely NEW subject/project
- Use <delete> only when explicitly requested by the user

**Decision Tree:**
"Create/Make/Build [new thing]" + NO artifact exists → CREATE
"Create/Make [new thing]" + Artifact exists + Different subject → DELETE then CREATE
"Add/Change/Update/Improve/Fix [existing]" → EDIT
"Make it [different]" / "Add [feature]" → EDIT
"Start over" / "New project" → DELETE then CREATE
"Remove/Delete artifact" → DELETE
```

---

## 🎨 Toast Notifications

| Operation | Status | Message |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| CREATE success | ✅ Success | "Artifact Created: [Title]" |
| CREATE blocked | ⚠️ Warning | "Artifact Already Exists" |
| EDIT success | ✅ Success | "Artifact Updated: [Title]" |
| EDIT blocked | ⚠️ Warning | "No Artifact to Edit" |
| DELETE success | ℹ️ Info | "Artifact Deleted" |

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Start
```
User: "Create a counter"
✅ CREATE allowed → Counter created
```

### Scenario 2: Blocked Creation
```
User: "Create a counter"  [Counter exists]
❌ CREATE blocked → Warning shown
```

### Scenario 3: Editing Existing
```
User: "Add a reset button"  [Counter exists]
✅ EDIT allowed → Counter updated
```

### Scenario 4: Deletion
```
User: "Delete the artifact"
✅ DELETE allowed → Artifact removed
```

### Scenario 5: Change Subject
```
User: "Delete this and make a calculator"
✅ DELETE → CREATE → Calculator created
```

### Scenario 6: Context-Aware Editing
```
Context sent: "Counter is active (type: react)"
User: "Change color to blue"
✅ AI uses EDIT → Color changed
```

---

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **No Duplicate Artifacts** - Only one artifact at a time, prevents confusion
2. **Intentional Edits** - Clear distinction between create and modify
3. **User Control** - Explicit delete operation
4. **AI Awareness** - Context ensures correct operation choice
5. **Better UX** - Appropriate warnings and notifications
6. **Smooth Iterations** - Easy to refine artifacts incrementally

---

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

The parser still supports the old format:

**Legacy Format:**
```xml
<artifact identifier="my-counter" type="react" title="Counter">
...
</artifact>
```

Automatically converted to `operation="create"` internally.

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Create → Edit → Delete

**Step 1 - Create:**
```
User: "Create a todo list"
AI: <artifact operation="create" type="react" title="Todo List">
Result: ✅ Todo list created
```

**Step 2 - Edit:**
```
User: "Add a delete button for each item"
AI: <artifact operation="edit" type="react" title="Todo List">
Result: ✅ Todo list updated with delete buttons
```

**Step 3 - Delete:**
```
User: "Remove the artifact"
AI: <artifact operation="delete"></artifact>
Result: ✅ Artifact removed, panel closed
```

### Example 2: Protection in Action

**Setup:**
```
User: "Make a counter"
AI: <artifact operation="create" ...>
Result: Counter created ✅
```

**Attempt Duplicate:**
```
User: "Make a calculator"
AI: <artifact operation="create" ...>  [Tries to create new]
Result: ❌ BLOCKED
Toast: "Artifact Already Exists - please edit or delete first"
Counter remains visible
```

**Correct Approach:**
```
User: "Delete the counter and make a calculator"
AI: <artifact operation="delete"></artifact>
    <artifact operation="create" ...>  [Calculator]
Result: ✅ Counter removed, Calculator created
```

## 🎉 Summary

**Before:** Artifacts could be created freely, replacing each other unpredictably  
**After:** Strict operation control - CREATE blocked if exists, EDIT for modifications

**Key Improvement:** Mistral AI now **understands** whether to create, edit, or delete based on context and user intent.

**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION READY
**Feature:** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**Protection:** ✅ ACTIVE

The artifact system now provides intentional, controlled artifact management! 🚀
