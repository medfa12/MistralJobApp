## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### Creating an Artifact
1. User asks Mistral to create a component (e.g., "Create a counter button")
2. Mistral responds with an `<artifact>` tag containing the code
3. The app automatically parses the artifact
4. A beautiful artifact card appears in the chat with:
   - Artifact title
   - Type badge (React/HTML/etc.)
   - Code view with syntax highlighting
   - Live preview
5. Success toast: "Artifact Created: 'Counter Button' is ready to preview"

### Inspecting Elements
1. User clicks the 🔍 icon in the Preview tab
2. Inspect mode activates (overlay appears, badge shows "🔍 Inspect Mode")
3. User hovers over elements → animated highlight boxes appear
4. User clicks an element → element is selected with pulsing animation
5. Inspector panel slides in from the right showing full details
6. Code snippet is automatically attached to the next message
7. Info toast: "Element Code Attached: <button> code ready to include"

### Using Inspected Code
1. Attached code appears as a purple chip above the input field
2. Shows: `Inspected: <button> #submit-btn .primary-btn`
3. Preview of the code snippet (first 100 chars)
4. User can remove it with the 'X' button
5. When user sends their next message, the code is included
6. Mistral can then modify or explain that specific element

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Artifact XML Format
```xml
<artifact identifier="unique-id" type="react" title="My Component">
  ```jsx
  function App() {
    return <div>Hello World</div>;
  }
  window.App = App;
  ```
</artifact>
```

### Supported Types
- **`react`** - React 18 with Hooks, inline styles (JSX transpilation via Babel)
- **`html`** - Standard HTML5 with inline CSS
- **`javascript`** - ES6+ with DOM manipulation
- **`vue`** - Vue 3 with Options/Composition API

### Security Features
- ✅ Sandboxed iframe execution (`allow-scripts allow-same-origin`)
- ✅ No external API calls (CORS restrictions)
- ✅ No file system access
- ✅ Code validation (dangerous patterns detected)
- ✅ Max code size limit (50KB)

### Animation System
All animations powered by Framer Motion:
- Tab transitions with slide/fade
- Inspector panel slide-in with spring physics
- Element highlight boxes with layout animations
- Selected element pulsing effects
- Hover scale effects on buttons
- Smooth morphing between different element sizes

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Page: `/test`
Four pre-built artifacts to demonstrate functionality:
1. **Interactive Counter** (React) - State management with buttons
2. **Mistral AI Card** (HTML) - Styled component card
3. **Contact Form** (React) - Form with validation and submission
4. **Dashboard Layout** (HTML) - Grid-based dashboard with metrics

### Manual Testing Checklist

## 🚀 Usage Example

**User:** "Create an interactive counter button with increment and decrement"

**Mistral Response:**
```
Here's an interactive counter component for you:

<artifact identifier="counter-demo" type="react" title="Interactive Counter">
  ```jsx
  function App() {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
    
    return (
      <div style={{ padding: '20px', textAlign: 'center' }}>
        <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  window.App = App;
  ```
</artifact>

This counter allows you to increment, decrement, or reset the count.
```

The artifact automatically renders in the chat as an interactive component!

## 📖 Developer Notes

### Adding a New Artifact Type
1. Add type to `ArtifactType` in `src/types/types.ts`
2. Update `getLanguageFromType` in `src/utils/artifactParser.ts`
3. Add rendering logic in `src/components/artifact/PreviewView.tsx`
4. Update validation in `validateArtifactCode`
5. Update system prompt to include the new type

### Modifying Animations
All animation variants are in `src/components/artifact/animations.ts`. Adjust durations, easing functions, and spring physics there.

### Customizing Inspector Panel
The inspector panel can be extended in `src/components/artifact/InspectorPanel.tsx` to show additional element properties like event listeners, parent nodes, etc.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No external npm packages** - Only CDN-based libraries work
2. **No API calls** - CORS restrictions in sandbox
3. **Vue SFCs not supported** - Only inline template syntax
4. **Single artifact per message** - Multiple artifacts show only the first one
5. **No persistence** - Artifacts not saved to database yet
6. **Limited code extraction** - Inspect mode shows rendered HTML, not original JSX
