## Sidebar Synchronization

### Event-Based Communication
The history page now dispatches a custom `conversationUpdated` event whenever:
- A conversation is renamed
- A conversation is deleted
- All conversations are deleted

The sidebar listens for this event and automatically refreshes its conversation list.

### Implementation Details:
```typescript
// Dispatch event after any conversation change
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('conversationUpdated'));
}
```

### Sidebar Refresh Triggers:
1. **Custom Event**: `conversationUpdated` event from history page
2. **Window Focus**: When user returns to the tab
3. **Visibility Change**: When tab becomes visible
4. **Polling**: Every 30 seconds (background refresh)
5. **Initial Load**: On component mount

This ensures the sidebar always shows the most up-to-date conversation list, regardless of where changes are made.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test delete all with multiple conversations
2. Verify Cloudinary attachments are deleted
3. Test view mode toggle persistence (could add localStorage)
4. Test responsive layout on mobile
5. Test pagination with delete all
6. Verify search works with both view modes
7. Test empty state after delete all
8. **Test sidebar refresh**: Rename/delete conversations in history page and verify sidebar updates immediately
9. **Test cross-page sync**: Delete from sidebar, navigate to history page and verify it's updated
10. **Test delete all sync**: Delete all conversations and verify sidebar shows "No conversations yet"
