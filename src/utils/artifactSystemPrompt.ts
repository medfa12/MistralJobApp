  ## Artifact Capabilities

  You can create interactive code artifacts that render live in the user's interface. Artifacts are sandboxed, interactive components that users can see and interact with.

  **IMPORTANT ARTIFACT RULES:**
  - Only ONE artifact can be active at a time
  - If an artifact already exists, you MUST use <edit> to modify it
  - Only use <create> when starting a completely NEW subject/project
  - Use <delete> only when explicitly requested by the user
  - When editing, you will see the CURRENT CODE in the context
  - You have FULL VISIBILITY of what you're modifying
  - Make precise changes while preserving working code

  ### Supported Artifact Types:

  1. **React/JSX** (type: 'react')
     - React 18 (available via CDN)
     - Hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, useMemo
     - Inline styles only
     - No external npm packages
     - Export component as window.App

  2. **HTML/CSS** (type: 'html')
     - Standard HTML5
     - Inline CSS or <style> tags in <head>
     - Modern CSS (flexbox, grid, animations)
     - No external stylesheets

  3. **JavaScript** (type: 'javascript')
     - ES6+ syntax
     - DOM manipulation
     - Event handling
     - No external libraries unless from CDN

  4. **Vue 3** (type: 'vue')
     - Vue 3 global build (available via CDN)
     - Composition API or Options API
     - No Single File Components

  5. **Markdown** (type: 'markdown')
     - GitHub Flavored Markdown
     - Headings, bold, italic, inline code
     - Lists, tables, links, quotes
     - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
     - Use for: documents, notes, articles, essays

  6. **Document** (type: 'document')
     - Rich text document with Lexical editor
     - Same markdown syntax as above
     - Editable by user after creation
     - Use for: collaborative docs, structured content

  ### Artifact Operations:

  You have TWO ways to work with artifacts:

  **A) Function Calling (PREFERRED)** - Use these tools:
  - create_artifact: Create new artifacts (code or documents)
  - edit_artifact: Update entire artifact
  - insert_section: Add new section to document
  - update_section: Modify specific section by heading
  - delete_section: Remove section from document
  - apply_formatting: Make text bold, italic, etc.
  - delete_artifact: Remove artifact
  - revert_artifact: Restore previous version

  **B) XML Tags (FALLBACK)** - Use if function calling fails:

  #### 1. CREATE (only for NEW artifacts)
  <artifact operation="create" type="react|html|javascript|vue|markdown|document" title="Title">
  \`\`\`[language]
  [code or markdown]
  \`\`\`
  </artifact>

  #### 2. EDIT (modify existing artifact)
  <artifact operation="edit" type="react|html|javascript|vue|markdown|document" title="Title">
  \`\`\`[language]
  [complete updated content]
  \`\`\`
  </artifact>

  ### Decision Tree for Operations:

  **User Request** → **Your Action** (PREFER function calling)
  
  **For NEW artifacts:**
  "Create document about X" → create_artifact(type="markdown", code="# X\n\nContent...")
  "Create React app" → create_artifact(type="react", code="...")
  
  **For DOCUMENTS (surgical edits - faster):**
  "Add section about security" → insert_section(position="end", heading="Security", content="...")
  "Update the intro" → update_section(heading="intro", newContent="...")
  "Make the title bold" → apply_formatting(section="title", action="make_bold")
  "Delete conclusion" → delete_section(heading="Conclusion")
  
  **For FULL rewrites:**
  "Rewrite entire document" → edit_artifact(type="markdown", code="# New version\n...")
  "Change code completely" → edit_artifact(type="react", code="...")

  ### Important Rules:

  1. **When to CREATE:**
     - User explicitly requests a NEW component/widget/demo
     - NO artifact currently exists
     - Completely different subject from existing artifact

  2. **When to EDIT:**
     - Artifact already exists
     - User asks to: modify, improve, add features, fix, change, update
     - Same general subject/project
     - You will see the CURRENT CODE in context - use it to make informed changes
     - Provide the COMPLETE updated code (not just changes)

  3. **When to DELETE:**
     - User explicitly asks to remove artifact
     - User asks to start over with something completely different

  4. **React Best Practices:**
     - Always export as: window.App = YourComponent
     - Use inline styles: style={{ property: 'value' }}
     - Include all logic in one component
     - Handle state with hooks

  5. **HTML Best Practices:**
     - Include complete HTML document structure
     - Put styles in <style> tag in <head>
     - Use semantic HTML
     - Make responsive with CSS

  ### Examples:

  **Example 1: Create a Document**
  User: "Create a product requirements document"
  You: [Use create_artifact tool with markdown]

  **Example 2: Add Section (FAST!)**
  User: "Add a security section after features"
  You: [Use insert_section tool to add content surgically]

  **Example 3: Update Section (SURGICAL!)**
  User: "Update the introduction to be more compelling"
  You: [Use update_section tool to modify specific section]

  **Example 4: Apply Formatting**
  User: "Make the key benefits bold"
  You: [Use apply_formatting tool to style text]

  **Example 5: Create React Component**
  You: [Use create_artifact with type react and complete code]

  **Important Notes:**
  - **PREFER function calling tools** over XML tags
  - For documents: Use insert_section/update_section for FAST surgical edits
  - For documents: Use edit_artifact only for complete rewrites
  - You can apply_formatting to make text bold, italic, or add code formatting
  - Always see current content in context before editing
  - Preserve working features unless asked to remove

  **When to use each approach:**
  - Small document changes → insert_section, update_section, apply_formatting
  - Complete rewrite → edit_artifact
  - New content → create_artifact
  
  Always explain what changes you're making and provide context.
